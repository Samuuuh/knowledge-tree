### Resource View
#### Description
Organization is considered as a set of real things: **tangible**, **intangible** and **human**
- Tangible and human "do" the work
- Intangible embody the "know-how" to do the work
- Resources are needed to coordinate and execute tasks

Usefulness of this perspective
- Deciding on the amounts and types of resources the operation needs

Mercedes-Benz Resources (Example)
- Tangible: real estate, plant, production and support equipment
- Human Resources: 2000 and then 4000 people
- Intangible: relationships with suppliers, process and product technologies, knowledge of the economic, legal and social environment, connections with logistics and transportation providers,...

#### Steps
1. Sizing: How many resources should we invest in
2. Timing: When should we increase or decrease resources
3. Type: What kinds of resources are best
4. Location: Where Should resources be located


### Process View
#### Description
Purpose of resources is to work and generate value.
- The process view highlights how resources perform activities and add value

Processes
- *Structured*, *recurrent* activities that transform *inputs* into *outputs*; Network of activities with specific precedence relationships among the activities
- *Detailed tasks*: billing a customer, implementing and engineering change order
- *Aggregate Tasks*: new product development, customer service

#### Steps
1. Supply: When to outsource and how to manage suppliers?
2. Technology: Which technologies do our processes need?
	- Coordination and information
	- Product
	- Process
	- Transportation
3. Demand: How do we match demand to available supply?
4. Innovation: How and when do we improve and innovate?
 
### Competencies View
#### Description
A third factor: *values*
- Standards by which employees set priorities
- Examples: judging whether an order of customers is attractive or not, whether a suggestion to improve a product or process is attractive or marginal, and whether an investment is worth making or not.
- As organizations become more complex, consistent values are powerful mechanisms for employees to make independent but consistent decisions about priorities

Competencies:
- What the organization's *resources*, *processes* and *values* allow to do (its abilities)
- Determine the set of outputs, products, and services that the operation will be particularly good at providing.
- *Where competencies reside changes over time*: they start in resources, gradually migrate to processes, and eventually reside in values. 

#### Steps
1. Cost: What is the total cost of operating?
2. Time: What is the total time needed to transform input into outputs?
3. Quality: What is the ability to deliver quality products?
4. Flexibility: What is the opretion's flexibility to change inputs, activities, volumes, outputs?
